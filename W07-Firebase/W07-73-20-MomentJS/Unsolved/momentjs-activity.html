    var randomDate = "02/23/1999";

    // Using scripts from moment.js write code below to complete each of the following.
    // Console.log to confirm the code changes we made worked.

    // 1 ...to convert the randomDate into three other date formats
    console.log(moment(randomDate).format("DD/MM/YY hh:mm A"));
    // 2 ...to determine the time in years, months, days between today and the randomDate
    // 3 ...to determine the number of days between the randomDate and 02/14/2001
    // 4 ...to convert the randomDate to unix time (be sure to look up what unix time even is!!!)
    // 5 ...to determine what day of the week and what week of the year this randomDate falls on.

    // If you finish early...
    // Start creating HTML inputs and then redisplay the dates using moment.js elsewhere on the page.

    // date.diff(date, "years")

Instructions:
With your group write out the steps you would use "mathematically" to determine the answer to the following situation:
Assuming:
The first train of the day comes in at 3:00 AM.
The train runs every 17 minutes
The current time is 7:12 PM.
There have been no delays and will be no delays.
Question:
How many minutes away is the next train?


{ [ HourInMin(currentTime) - HourInMin(startTime) ] % 17 }
  1152 - 180 
  972 
  972 / 17 = 57.176
